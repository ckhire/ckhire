## Introduction
The focus of this document is to demonstrate one among many issues which is faced generally while writing the pre-processing or post-processing functions referred from one framework to putting it in another framework. Let'us directly jump to our topic.

### Multi-Attribut Detection Openvino pre-trained Model
Refer [person attribute recognition](https://docs.openvino.ai/2023.0/omz_models_model_person_attributes_recognition_crossroad_0230.html#doxid-omz-models-model-person-attributes-recognition-crossroad-0230) from openvino pre-trained model

## Pre-processing
