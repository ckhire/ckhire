Title: Bridging the Gap: Bringing GitHub-like Collaboration On-Premises

Missing Fun:
Being part of a long-standing organization with a legacy in the Vision AI domain is a source of immense pride. However, amidst the excitement of tackling new challenges, the method of accomplishing tasks and maintaining clear communication with stakeholders and managers often gets lost. This can lead to confusion among team members, impacting productivity and morale. Missing GitHub in such scenarios is palpable, especially when the development philosophy emphasizes finalizing code before committing, leaving individual performers struggling to navigate through the chaos.

Search for On-premise GitHub:
While GitLab emerges as a viable alternative, its extensive feature set and organizational implications make it a significant decision. Exploring options led me to Gitea, a lightweight solution that aligns perfectly with my needs.
